<title>Advanced Usage</title>
<simpara>This covers advanced topics and builds on the <emphasis>Using the APIs</emphasis> section.</simpara>
<section id="_batched_bulk_operations">
<title>Batched (Bulk) Operations</title>
<simpara>Most API functions have both single and multi-key (batched) variants.
The batched variant will be of the same name as the single-key variant,
but have its method name appended with <literal>_multi</literal>.</simpara>
<simpara>The batched operations are significantly quicker and more efficient, especially
when dealing with many small values, as they allow pipelining of requests and
responses, saving on network latency.</simpara>
<simpara>Batched operations tend to accept an iterable of keys (or a dict of keys,
depending on the method) and return a dictionary of the following format</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">c.foo_multi(["key1", "key2", "key3"])

{
    "key1" : FooResult(...),
    "key2" : FooResult(...),
    "key3" : FooResult(...)
}</programlisting>
<section id="_exceptions_in_batched_operations">
<title>Exceptions in Batched Operations</title>
<simpara>Sometimes a single key in a batched operation may fail, resulting in an
exception. It is still possible to retrieve the full result set of the
failed batched operation by using the <literal>all_results</literal> property of the
thrown exception (assuming it is of type <literal>CouchbaseError</literal>)</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">c.set("foo", "foo value")

try:
    c.add_multi({
        "foo" : "foo value",
        "bar" : "bar value",
        "baz" : "baz value"
    })
except CouchbaseError as exc:
    for k, res in exc.all_results.items():
        if res.success:
            # Handle successful operation
        else:
            print "Key {0} failed with error code {1}".format(k, res.rc)
            print "Exception {0} would have been thrown".format(
                CouchbaseError.rc_to_exctype(res.rc))</programlisting>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_using_with_and_without_threads">
<title>Using With and Without Threads</title>
<simpara>The <literal>Connection</literal> object by default is thread safe. In order to do so, it uses
internal locks and explicitly locks and unlocks the Python <emphasis>GIL</emphasis> to ensure
that a fatal error is not thrown by the application.</simpara>
<simpara>The locking and unlocking has a slight performance impact, with the guarantee
that things will not crash if an application is using threads.</simpara>
<simpara>If you are not using threads in your application (at all), you may pass the
<literal>unlock_gil=False</literal> option to the <literal>connect</literal> method like so:</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">c = Couchbase.connect(unlock_gil=False, bucket='default')</programlisting>
<simpara>This will disable all locking/unlocking (not to be confused with the <literal>lock</literal>
and <literal>unlock</literal> features which operate on keys in the server) functionality.
If your application does use threads, those threads will be <emphasis role="strong">blocked</emphasis> while
the <literal>Connection</literal> object waits for the server to respond.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition to locking and unlocking the <emphasis>GIL</emphasis>, upon entry to each function
the <literal>Connection</literal> object locks itself (using the equivalent of <literal>Lock.acquire</literal>)
and unlocks itself once it leaves. This is to ensure that multiple threads
are not using the same <literal>Connection</literal> object at once; and thus access is
serialized.</simpara>
<simpara>You may disable this behavior with the following two options:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Don&#8217;t lock at all
</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>Connection</literal> object is not locked at all. If your application will try to
use the <literal>Connection</literal> object from multiple threads at once, strange errors may
happen and your program will eventually core dump.</simpara>
<simpara>If you&#8217;re sure you&#8217;re not going to use it from more than one thread, you can
use the <literal>lockmode = LOCKMODE_NONE</literal> in the constructor</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">from couchbase import Couchbase, LOCKMODE_NONE
c = Couchbase.connect(bucket='default', lockmode=LOCKMODE_NONE)</programlisting>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Throw an exception if concurrent access is detected
</simpara>
<simpara>This is helpful for debugging an application where multiple threads <emphasis role="strong">should</emphasis>
not be accessing the <literal>Connection</literal> object (but for some reason, they are). You
can use the <literal>lockmode = LOCKMODE_EXC</literal> for this</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">from couchbase import Couchbase, LOCKMODE_EXC
c = Couchbase.connect(bucket='default', lockmode=LOCKMODE_EXC)</programlisting>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>The default lockmode is <literal>couchbase.LOCKMODE_WAIT</literal> which waits silently if
concurrent access is detected</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_custom_encodings_conversions">
<title>Custom Encodings/Conversions</title>
<simpara>While the Python SDK offers numerous options for converting your data to be
suitable for storing on the server, it may sometimes not be enough. For this,
the <literal>Transcoder</literal> interface is used.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>Transcoder</literal> interface allows you to define an object which is called
with each value together with the <literal>format</literal> arguments passed to it.</simpara>
<section id="_formats_and_flags">
<title>Formats and Flags</title>
<simpara>The value passed for the <literal>format</literal> parameter is actually a flag which is stored
on the server. Each key has a small amount of metadata which is stored with it
along on the server. The Python SDK stores the <literal>format</literal> value to the metadata
when you store a value (using <literal>set</literal>) and then reads it when retrieving the
value (using <literal>get</literal>). If the flag is equal to <literal>FMT_JSON</literal> then it attempts to
decode it as JSON; if the flag is equal to <literal>FMT_PICKLE</literal> then it attempts to
decode it as Pickle, and so on.</simpara>
<simpara>You may pass the <literal>FMT_AUTO</literal> flag to <literal>set</literal>, in which case it will guess the
suitable format for your data based on the Python datatype being used.</simpara>
<simpara>Additionally, you can pass the <literal>no_format</literal> option to <literal>get</literal> to suppress automatic
conversion of the value to a native Python type (the <literal>bytes</literal> type will be used
instead). This may be useful when conversion is not needed, or if other issues
arise when decoding a format (for example, a Pickle version mismatch).</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_custom_literal_transcoder_literal_objects">
<title>Custom <literal>Transcoder</literal> Objects</title>
<simpara>You can write a custom transcoder which will allow <emphasis>Zlib</emphasis> compression;
here&#8217;s a snippet</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">import zlib

from couchbase.transcoder import Transcoder
from couchbase import FMT_MASK

# We'll define our own flag.
FMT_ZLIB = (FMT_MASK &lt;&lt; 1) &amp; ~FMT_MASK

class ZlibTranscoder(Transcoder):
    def encode_value(self, value, format):
        converted, flags = super(ZlibTranscoder, self).encode_value(value, format &amp; FMT_MASK)
        if (format &amp; FMT_ZLIB):
            flags |= FMT_ZLIB
            converted = zlib.compress(converted)
        return (converted, flags)

    def decode_value(self, value, flags):
        if (format &amp; FMT_ZLIB):
            value = zlib.decompress(value)
            format &amp;= FMT_MASK
        return super(ZlibTranscoder, self).decode_value(value, flags)</programlisting>
<simpara>In the above example, the <literal>ZlibTranscoder</literal> class is defined as a subclass of the
provided <literal>couchbase.transcoder.Transcoder</literal> class. The latter is a wrapper class
which defaults to use the default conversion methods in the SDK (note that the
library does not use any <literal>Transcoder</literal> object by default, but the provided
one wraps the built-in converters.</simpara>
<simpara>For <literal>encode_value</literal> we are passed the user-specified value (which is any Python
object) and a <literal>format</literal> value, which too can be any valid Python object (though
the default transcoder only accepts the <literal>FMT_JSON</literal>, <literal>FMT_UTF8</literal>, <literal>FMT_BYTES</literal>
and <literal>FMT_PICKLE</literal> values.</simpara>
<simpara>We define an additional format flag called <literal>FMT_ZLIB</literal>. We make this one higher
than <literal>FMT_MASK</literal> (which is the bitmask for the built-in formatting flags).</simpara>
<simpara>In <literal>encode_value</literal> we first call our parent&#8217;s <literal>encode_value</literal> (only passing the
relevant bits of the <literal>format</literal>) and receive the converted value and output flags
back (in reality, output flags will typically be the same as the format flags.</simpara>
<simpara>Then we convert the already-converted value and compress it as <emphasis>zlib</emphasis>. We then
AND the flag with our <literal>FMT_ZLIB</literal> bit, and return it. The value and flag returned
from the <literal>encode_value</literal> method are stored as is on the server.</simpara>
<simpara>We then do the converse when reading data back from the server in <literal>decode_value</literal>.
In this method we are passed the value as it is stored on the server, along with
the numeric flags as they are stored in the key&#8217;s metadata. We check to see
first whether there is any special <literal>FMT_ZLIB</literal> flag applied, and if so,
decompress the data and strip those bits from the flag. Then we dispatch it to
the default <literal>decode_value</literal> to handle any further encapulation formats.</simpara>
<simpara>This may all be used like so from Python</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered"># assuming the ZlibTrancoder class is defined above

c = Couchbase.connect(transcoder=ZlibTranscoder(), bucket='default')
c.set("foo", "long value" * 1000, format=FMT_BYTES|FMT_ZLIB)
c.get("foo")</programlisting>
</section>
<section id="_bypassing_conversion">
<title>Bypassing Conversion</title>
<simpara>If you are having difficulties with reading some value from the server
(possibly because it was stored using a different client with different
flag semantics) then you may disable conversion (when retrieving) entirely
by using the <literal>Connection</literal> object&#8217;s <literal>data_passthrough</literal> property. This is a
boolean, and when enabled does not deconvert the value (i.e. it does not
call <literal>decode_value</literal> but simply interprets the value as a sequence of bytes
and returns them as part of the <literal>Result</literal> object&#8217;s <literal>value</literal> property</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">c.set("a_dict", {"foo":"bar"})
c.data_passthrough = True
c.get("a_dict").value == b'{"foo":"bar"}'</programlisting>
</section>
</section>
<section id="_item_api">
<title>Item API</title>
<simpara>The <literal>Item</literal> API introduced in version 1.1 introduces a more streamlined way to
deal with Couchbase documents and key-value entries.</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>Item</literal> API represents a persistent object in your application which may be
passed by your application to any of the SDK <literal>_multi</literal> APIs. When this object is
passed, the result of the operation is stored within the <literal>Item</literal> object itself,
rather than creating a new result object.</simpara>
<simpara>This allows developers to avoid some common boilerplate methods such as
converting a <literal>Result</literal> object to their internal application structure. In fact,
the <literal>Item</literal> object itself is a subclass of <literal>ValueResult</literal></simpara>
<simpara>All methods accepting <literal>Items</literal> should be passed a collection of items. These
collections must be the special classes of either an <literal>ItemOptionDict</literal> or an
<literal>ItemSequence</literal>. The former can be used to specify additional arguments for
each individual item (such as <literal>CAS</literal>, <literal>format</literal>, and the like), while the latter
may be used if no specific options are required.</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">#!/usr/bin/python
from pprint import pprint

from couchbase import Couchbase, FMT_UTF8
from couchbase.items import Item, ItemSequence, ItemOptionDict


# The Item API allows subclassing.
class MyItem(Item):
    def print_value(self):
        pprint(self.value, indent=4)

cb = Couchbase.connect(bucket='default')

# Create blank item
itm = MyItem()

# Must set a key before we do anything with it
itm.key = "simple_key"

# We'll first store it
itm.value = "Hello World"

# Now, we need a sequence for the item.
itmcoll = ItemSequence([itm])
cb.set_multi(itmcoll, format=FMT_UTF8)

itm.print_value()

# Let's append some data to it. We use the special 'append_items' method
# However, append requires a 'fragment' option for each item, so we need
# to make 'itmcoll' an ItemOptionsDict

itmcoll = ItemOptionDict()
itmcoll.add(itm, fragment=" ..again")
cb.append_items(itmcoll, format=FMT_UTF8)
itm.print_value()

<section id="_persistence_durability_requirements">
<title>Persistence/Durability Requirements</title>
<simpara>Persistence requirements are provided to allow an application developer to
ensure that a given mutation operation has been performed and
propagated to more than one node in the cluster. By default, operations are
considered successful if they are stored in the RAM of a single node. Using
the <literal>persist_to</literal> and <literal>replicate_to</literal> arguments in the <literal>set</literal> family of methods
you may specify stricted requirements, for example to replicate to at least
two nodes, and to have it persisted on at least one node&#8217;s disk.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that Couchbase will always <emphasis>eventually</emphasis> store each item on all of its
associated replicas, in both disk and memory. The persistence requirements
are there as a means for the application developer to synchronize his/her
code so that the application does not continue until those requirements are
met.</simpara>
<simpara>See the API reference for more information on how to use these parameters.</simpara>

<section id="_logging_and_debugging">
<title>Logging and Debugging</title>
<simpara>This section will cover how to uncover bugs in your application (or in the SDK
itself).</simpara>
<section id="_components">
<title>Components</title>
<simpara>To debug anything, it is necessary to be able to identify in which domain a
problem is found. Specifically there are four components which participate
in typical Couchbase operation</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Couchbase Server
</simpara>
<simpara>This is the server itself which stores your data. Errors can happen here if your
data does not exist, or if there are connectivity issues with one or more nodes
in the server. Note that while Couchbase Server is scalable and fault tolerant,
there are naturally some conditions which would cause failures (for example, if
all nodes are unreachable).</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
libcouchbase
</simpara>
<simpara>This is the underlying layer which handles network communication and protocol
handling between a client and a Couchbase node. Network connectivity issues
tend to happen here.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Python C Extension Layer
</simpara>
<simpara>This is the C code which provides the bulk of the SDK. It interfaces with
the libcouchbase component, creates <literal>Result</literal> objects, performs input
validation and encoding/decoding of keys and values</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
Python Layer
</simpara>
<simpara>This is written in pure python. For simple key-value operations these normally
just dispatch to the C layer. Most of the view option and row code is handled
here as well, with the C layer just performing the lower level network handling.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
</section>
<section id="_exception_handling">
<title>Exception Handling</title>
<simpara>When something goes wrong, an exception of <literal>CouchbaseError</literal> is typically thrown.
The exception object contains a lot of information which can be used to find out
what went wrong.</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">from couchbase import Couchbase
from couchbase.exceptions import CouchbaseError

c = Couchbase.connect(bucket='default')
try:
    # Will fail because 'object' is not JSON-serializable
    c.set("key", object())
except CouchbaseError as e:
    print e</programlisting>
<simpara>Printing the exception object will typically produce something like this:</simpara>

</section>
<section id="_application_crashes">
<title>Application Crashes</title>
<simpara>As this is a C extension, some fatal errors may result in an application crash.
On Unix-based systems, these typically look like this:</simpara>
<screen>python: src/callbacks.c:132: get_common_objects: Assertion `PyDict_Contains((PyObject*)*mres, hkey) == 0' failed.
Aborted</screen>
<simpara>Or simply</simpara>
<screen>Segmentation Fault</screen>
<simpara>While the actual cause may be in the application code or in the SDK itself,
there is often less information available in debugging it.</simpara>
<simpara>The SDK should never crash under normal circumstances, and any application
crash ultimately indicates a bug in the SDK itself (invalid user input should
result in a Python exception being thrown).</simpara>
<simpara>To better help us fix the SDK, a C <emphasis>backtrace</emphasis> is needed. To generate a helpful
backtrace, Python should be available with debugging symbols (this can be done
by installing <literal>python-dbg</literal> or <literal>python-debuginfo</literal> from your distribution.
Likewise, <literal>libcouchbase</literal> itself should also be installed with debugging symbols
(this can be done by installing <literal>libcouchbase2-dbg</literal> or <literal>libcouchbase2-debuginfo</literal>
depending on your distribution).</simpara>
<simpara>You will also need <literal>gdb</literal> (this is also available on any distribution).</simpara>
<simpara>When you have the desired debugging symbols, invoke <literal>gdb</literal> as follows:</simpara>
<simpara>We assume <literal>python</literal> is a Python interpreter, and <literal>crash.py</literal> is a script
which can trigger the crash.</simpara>

<title>Debugging an already-running application</title>
<simpara>Often in the case of webservers, it is difficult to invoke the script directly.
In this case, you need to debug an already-running application. This can be

In this case, you can attach <literal>gdb</literal> to the running process like so:</simpara>
<screen>shell&gt; gdb -p 29342

<simpara>Once <literal>gdb</literal> has attached, you can type <literal>continue</literal> (instead of <literal>r</literal>) to

<simpara>This shows us that an application crashed. When this happens, <literal>gdb</literal> will print
the location of the crash. This is not enough, however as we need the full
