with the Python SDK. We&#8217;ll first show how to install the SDK and then demonstrate
how it can be used to perform some simple operations.</simpara>

<title>Hello Couchbase</title>
<simpara>To follow the tradition of programming tutorials, we&#8217;ll start with
"Hello Couchbase". Note that this example expects you to have installed
the "beer-sample" bucket (which is provided with the default install).</simpara>
<formalpara><title>hello-couchbase.py</title><para>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">from couchbase import Couchbase

</para></formalpara>
<simpara>While this code should be simple, we&#8217;ll explain each step in greater detail:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<emphasis role="strong">Connecting</emphasis>
</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>Couchbase.connect</literal> class method constructs a new
<literal>couchbase.connection.Connection</literal> object. This object represents a connection
to a single bucket within the cluster. Arguments passed to <literal>connect</literal> are passed
to the constructor (see API documentation on the <literal>Connection</literal> object for more
details and options).</simpara>
<simpara>A bucket represents a logical namespace for a key. All keys must be unique within
a single bucket, but multiple buckets can have keys with the same names (and they
will not conflict). A new connection object must be created for each bucket you
wish to interact with in your application. Here we are creating one connection
to the <literal>beer-sample</literal> bucket.</simpara>
<simpara>The constructor is passed the bucket name (which is <literal>beer-sample</literal>), and a node
on the cluster to connect to. Note that you can pass any node that is a member
of the cluster. In this case, I&#8217;m using my local cluster instance.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<emphasis role="strong">Retrieving Data</emphasis>
</simpara>
<simpara>The <literal>get</literal> method retrieves the value for the key requested. If the key exists,
a <literal>Result</literal> object is returned containing the value of the key as well as
additional metadata. To get the actual value of the object, you can access the
<literal>Result</literal> object&#8217;s <literal>value</literal> property.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that if the key does not exist on the server, an exception of type
<literal>CouchbaseError</literal> is thrown. This exception object can be caught and examined
or printed to see more details about why the operation failed. See the API
documentation for more details.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that we treat the <literal>value</literal> as a <literal>dict</literal> object. As a documented oriented
database, values stored to the server are considered to be JSON by default,
and when retrieve from the server are interpreted to be JSON (and unserialized
into a Python dict). It is possible to use other formats than the default JSON,
however. The <literal>set</literal> methods accept a <literal>format</literal> keyword argument which indicates
the conversion type to be used. The default is <literal>couchbase.FMT_JSON</literal>, but you
may also use <literal>couchbase.FMT_BYTES</literal>, <literal>couchbase.FMT_UTF8</literal>, or
<literal>couchbase.FMT_PICKLE</literal> instead. If none of these are sufficient, you may even
write your own custom <literal>Transcoder</literal> object to handle conversion on your own.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Starting from version 1.1.0, you may also use the <literal>couchbase.FMT_AUTO</literal> flag
which will guess the suitable format based on the Python datatype being passed.</simpara>
<simpara>+</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<emphasis role="strong">Storing Data</emphasis>
</simpara>
<simpara>To store documents in the server, you can use one of the <literal>set</literal> family of
methods. Here we use <literal>replace</literal> which enforces the constraint that a previous
value of the document must already exist. This can be thought of as an <emphasis>update</emphasis>
operation in terms of <emphasis>C.R.U.D.</emphasis> (Create, Read, Update, Delete).</simpara>
<simpara>The storage methods also return a <literal>Result</literal> object containing metadata about the
value stored.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Now we&#8217;re ready to run our first Couchbase Program:</simpara>
<literallayout class="monospaced">shell&gt; python hello-couchbase.py</literallayout>
<literallayout class="monospaced">Jule&#248;l, ABV: 5.9
OperationResult&lt;RC=0x0, Key=aass_brewery-juleol, CAS=0x428e4317cfe60000&gt;</literallayout>
<simpara>The first line outputs the <emphasis>name</emphasis> field of the document, and the second line
outputs the <literal>Result</literal> object of the replace operation.</simpara>
</section>
<section id="_working_with_documents">
<title>Working With Documents</title>
<simpara>A document in Couchbase server consists of a <emphasis>key</emphasis>, <emphasis>value</emphasis>, and <emphasis>metadata</emphasis>.
We will explain the following briefly</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<emphasis role="strong">Key</emphasis>
</simpara>
<simpara>A key is a unique identifier for your data. Each document must have its unique
key. The key can be any valid unicode string.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<emphasis role="strong">Value</emphasis>
</simpara>
<simpara>The value is your own application data which exists under the key. The format
of the value can be anything. By default, only JSON-serializable object are
supported (that is, Python <literal>str</literal>, <literal>unicode</literal>, <literal>dict</literal>, <literal>list</literal>, <literal>tuple</literal>,
<literal>int</literal>, <literal>long</literal>, <literal>float</literal>, <literal>bool</literal>, and <literal>None</literal> types) - in short, anything that the
standard <literal>json.dumps</literal> will accept.
The reason JSON is the default format is for the ability to later query the
database based on value contents, as will be explained later.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that it is possible to also store arbitrary Python objects using the
<literal>FMT_PICKLE</literal> value for the <literal>format</literal> option.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<emphasis role="strong">Metadata</emphasis>
</simpara>
<simpara>This contains information concerning the format of the value (e.g. whether it&#8217;s
JSON, Pickle, or something else). It also contains revision information - such
as the <emphasis>CAS</emphasis>, which we&#8217;ll read about later.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>You can <emphasis>store</emphasis> documents by providing the unique <emphasis>key</emphasis> under which the document
will be stored, and the <emphasis>value</emphasis> which contains the actual document. You can
<emphasis>retrieve</emphasis> documents either by directly specifying the unique <emphasis>key</emphasis> under which
the document was stored, or by querying <emphasis>views</emphasis> which will retrieve information
about documents based on specific <emphasis>criteria</emphasis> - which will yield the
documents that match it.</simpara>
<section id="_storing_documents">
<title>Storing Documents</title>
<simpara>This section provides a bit more insight in how to store documents. This is a
prerequisite to demonstrate how to retrieve documents (as there must be
something to retrieve)</simpara>
<note><simpara>There are additional storage methods beyond those described here,
which are covered in the Advanced section.
These include manipulating numeric
counters, setting expiration times for documents, and
appending/prepending to existing values.</simpara></note>
<simpara>The <literal>Connection</literal> object has three different store operations which conform to
the <emphasis>CRUD</emphasis> model:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>set(key, value)</literal>
</simpara>
<simpara>This stores the document <literal>value</literal> under the key <literal>key</literal>. If the key did not
previously exist, it is created. If the key already exists, its existing
value is overwritten with the new contents of <literal>value</literal>.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>add(key, value)</literal>
</simpara>
<simpara>This stores the document <literal>value</literal> under the key <literal>key</literal>, but only if <literal>key</literal>
does <emphasis>not already exist</emphasis>. If <literal>key</literal> already exists, an exception is thrown.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>replace(key, value)</literal>
</simpara>
<simpara>This is the inverse of <literal>add</literal>. This will set the contents of <literal>key</literal> to
<literal>value</literal>, but only if the <emphasis>key already exists</emphasis>. If the key does not
already exist, an exception is thrown.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>delete(key)</literal>
</simpara>
<simpara>Deletes the key <literal>key</literal> from the bucket. Future attempts to access this key
via <literal>get</literal> will raise an exception until something is stored again for this
key using one of the <literal>set</literal> methods.</simpara>
</listitem>

<section id="_getting_documents_by_key">
<title>Getting Documents By Key</title>
<simpara>Couchbase allows two ways to fetch your documents: You can retrieve a
document by its <emphasis>key</emphasis>, or you can retrieve a set of documents which
match some constraint using Views. Since views are more complex, we&#8217;ll
first demonstrate getting documents by their keys.</simpara>
<simpara>To get a single document, simply supply the key as the first argument to
the <literal>get</literal> method. It will return a <literal>Result</literal> object on success which can
then be used to extract the value.</simpara>
<formalpara><title>Getting A Single Document</title><para>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">client.store("my list", [])
result = client.get("my list")
doc = result.value</programlisting>
</para></formalpara>
<simpara>To get multiple documents, you may use the more efficient <literal>get_multi</literal>
method. It is passed an iterable sequence of keys, and returns a
dict-like object (this is actually a dict subclass called <literal>MultiResult</literal>)
with the keys passed to <literal>get_multi</literal> as keys, and the
values being a <literal>Result</literal> object for the result of each key.</simpara>
<formalpara><title>Getting Multiple Documents</title><para>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">client.set_multi({
    'sheep_counting' : ['first sheep', 'second sheep'],
    'famous_sheep' : {'sherry lewis' : 'Lamb Chops'}
})

keys = ('sheep_counting', 'famous_sheep')
results = client.get_multi(keys)
for key, result in results.items():
    doc = result.value</programlisting>
</para></formalpara>
<tip>
<title>Error Handling</title>
<simpara>Note that if a document does not exist, a <literal>couchbase.exceptions.NotFoundError</literal>
(which is a subclass of <literal>couchbase.exceptions.CouchbaseError</literal> is thrown).</simpara>
<simpara>You can change this behavior by using the <literal>quiet</literal> keyword parameter and setting
it to true (to suppress exceptions for a specific <literal>get</literal> call) or by setting the
<literal>Connection.quiet</literal> property on the <literal>Connection</literal> object (which will supress
exceptions on <literal>get</literal> for subsequent calls).</simpara>
<simpara>When using <literal>quiet</literal>, you can still determine if a key was retrieved successfuly
by examining the <literal>success</literal> property of the value object</simpara>
<formalpara><title>Passing <literal>quiet</literal> to <literal>get</literal></title><para>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">result = client.get("non-exist-key", quiet=True)
if result.success:
    print "Got document OK"
else:
    print ("Couldn't retrieve document. "

result = client.get("non-exist-key")
if result.success:
    print "Got document OK"
else:
    print "Couldn't retrieve document"</programlisting>
</para></formalpara>
<simpara>The <literal>rc</literal> property of the <literal>Result</literal> object contains the error code received
on failure (on success, its value is <literal>0</literal>). You can also obtain the exception
class which would have been thrown by using</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">&gt;&gt;&gt; CouchbaseError.rc_to_exctype(result.rc)
&lt;class 'couchbase.exceptions.NotFoundError'&gt;</programlisting>
<simpara>This class method is passed an error code and produces the appropriate
exception class.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that on <literal>get_multi</literal> with the quiet option enabled, you can immediately
determine if all the keys were fetched successfully or not by examining the
returned <literal>MultiResult</literal> 's <literal>all_ok</literal> property.</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">results = client.get_multi(("i exist", "but i don't"), quiet=True)

    print "Couldn't get all keys"</programlisting>
</tip>
</section>
<section id="_getting_documents_by_querying_views">
<title>Getting Documents by Querying Views</title>
<simpara>In addition to fetching documents by keys, you may also employ <emphasis>Views</emphasis> to retrieve
information using secondary indexes. This guide gets you started on how to use
them from the Python SDK. If you want to learn more about views, see the
<ulink url="http://www.couchbase.com/docs/couchbase-manual-2.0/couchbase-views.html">
chapter in the Couchbase Server 2.0 documentation</ulink></simpara>
<simpara>First, create your view definition using the web UI (though you may also do
this directly from the Python SDK, as will be shown later).</simpara>
<simpara>You can then query the view results by calling the <literal>query</literal> method on the
<literal>Connection</literal> object. Simply pass it the design and view name.</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">view_results = client.query("beer", "brewery_beers")
for result in view_results:
    print "Mapped key: %r" % (result.key,)
    print "Emitted value: %r" % (result.value,)
    print "Document ID: %s" % (result.docid,)</programlisting>
<simpara>The <literal>query</literal> method returns a <literal>couchbase.views.iterator.View</literal> object which
is an iterator. You may simply iterate over it to retrieve the results
for the query. Each object yielded is a <literal>ViewRow</literal> which is a simple object
containing the key, value, document ID, and optionally the document itself
for each of the results returned by the view.</simpara>
<simpara>In addition to passing the design and view name, the <literal>query</literal> method accepts
additional keyword arguments which control the behavior of the results
returned. You may thus use it like so:</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">results = client.query("beer", "brewery_beers", opt1=value1, opt2=value2, ...)
for result in results:
    # do something with result..</programlisting>
<simpara>Here are some of the available parameters for the <literal>query</literal> method. A full listing
may be found in the API documentation.</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>include_docs</literal>
</simpara>
<simpara>This boolean parameter indicates whether the corresponding document should be
retrieved for each row fetched. If this is true, the <literal>doc</literal> property of the
<literal>ViewRow</literal> object yielded by the iterator returned by <literal>query</literal> will contain
a <literal>Result</literal> object containing the document for the key.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>reduce</literal>
</simpara>
<simpara>This boolean parameter indicates whether the server should also pass the results
to the view&#8217;s <literal>reduce</literal> function. An exception is raised if the view does not have
a <literal>reduce</literal> method defined.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>limit</literal>
</simpara>
<simpara>This numeric parameter indicates the maximum amount of results to fetch from
the query. This is handy if your query can produce a lot of results</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>descending</literal>
</simpara>
<simpara>This boolean parameter indicates that the results should be returned in
reversed (descending) order.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>stale</literal>
</simpara>
<simpara>This boolean parameter can be used to control the tradeoff between performance
and freshness of data.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>debug</literal>
</simpara>
<simpara>This boolean parameter will also fetch low-level debugging information from the
view engine.</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
<literal>streaming</literal>
</simpara>
<simpara>This boolean parameter indicates whether the view results should be decoded
in a <emphasis>streaming</emphasis> manner. When enabled, the iterator will internally fetch
chunks of the response as required.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>As this is less efficient than fetching all results at once, it is disabled by
default, but can be very useful if you have a large dataset as it prevents the
entire view from being buffered in memory.</simpara>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">results = client.query("beer", "brewery_beers",
                       include_docs=True, limit=5)

<simpara>You can also store arbitrary strings of bytes by using <literal>FMT_BYTES</literal></simpara>
<note><simpara>In Python 2 (2.6 and above) <literal>bytes</literal> and <literal>str</literal> are the same type; however
in Python 3, a <literal>str</literal> is a string with an encoding (i.e. Python 2&#8217;s <literal>unicode</literal>)
while <literal>bytes</literal> is a sequence of bytes which must be explicitly converted in
order to be used with text operations.</simpara></note>
<programlisting language="python" linenumbering="unnumbered">import pprint

from couchbase import Couchbase, FMT_BYTES

c = Couchbase.connect(bucket='default')
c.set("blob", b"\x01\x02\x03\x04", format=FMT_BYTES)

<simpara>Or use <literal>FMT_UTF8</literal> to store a <literal>unicode</literal> object represented as <emphasis>UTF-8</emphasis></simpara>
<note><simpara>While JSON is also capable of storing strings and Unicode, the JSON specification
mandates that all strings begin and end with a quote (<literal>"</literal>). This uses up needless
space and costs extra processing power in "decoding" and "encoding" your JSON
string. Therefore you can save on performance by using <literal>FMT_UTF8</literal> for simple
strings</simpara></note>
<note><simpara>It is possible to encode your data in other encodings
other than <emphasis>UTF-8</emphasis>. However since the view engine operates using <emphasis>UTF-8</emphasis>, we
select this as the default. If you need a different encoding, consider using
the <literal>Transcoder</literal> interface.</simpara></note>

<title>Setting The Default Format</title>
<simpara>You can set the default format for the value type you use most by
setting the <literal>default_format</literal> property on the connection object,
either during construction or afterwards:</simpara>
